= btrfs-scrub-scheduler

Smart scheduler for BTRFS scrubbing.
Make `btrfs scrub` run only during the maintenance window.

*Problem:*

You want to periodically scrub your BTRFS filesystems,
but it takes too long to scrub them all at once
and the IO is overloaded during scrubbing.

*Solution:*

Use this scheduler to run `btrfs scrub` only during the maintenance window.

== Implementation

Scrubbing is run only during the maintenance window and distributed over several days:

* `btrfs-scrub-scheduler` is supposed to run daily at the beginning of the maintenance window.
* track the last scrub date of each filesystem to know when a scrub should be run next time
* interrupt scrubbing at the end of the maintenance window
* resume scrubbing on the next run

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

You will need the following tools on your server:

* Node.js to run the scheduler

Running this should suffice on a recent Debian or Ubuntu:

----
apt install git nodejs
----

=== Setup

1. Download the latest release:
+
----
wget -O /usr/local/bin/btrfs-scrub-scheduler https://github.com/antrew/btrfs-scrub-scheduler/releases/latest/download/btrfs-scrub-scheduler
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/btrfs-scrub-scheduler
----
2. Configure the period and filesystems you want to scrub by creating `config.json` that looks like this:
+
----
{
  "period": 30,
  "maxDuration": "PT7H",
  "filesystems": [
    "/",
    "/mnt/example"
  ]
}
----
3. Create a cronjob that will start the scheduler daily at the beginning of the maintenance window.

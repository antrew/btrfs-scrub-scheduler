= btrfs-scrub-scheduler

Smart scheduler for BTRFS scrubbing. Make `btrfs scrub` run only during the maintenance window.

*Problem:*

You want to periodically scrub your BTRFS filesystems,
but it takes too long to scrub them all at once
and the IO is overloaded during scrubbing.

*Solution:*

Use this scheduler to run `btrfs scrub` only during the maintenance window.


== Implementation

The current implementation is trivial:

* `btrfs-scrub-scheduler` is supposed to run daily at the beginning of the maintenance window.
* it tracks the last scrub date of each filesystem to know when a scrub should be run next time
* it scrubs *only one filesystem at once*, so that scrubbing all filesystems will be distributed over several days

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

You will need the following tools on your server:

* Git to clone this repository
* Node.js to run the scheduler
* NPM to install dependencies

Running this should suffice on a recent Debian or Ubuntu:

----
apt install git nodejs
----

=== Setup

1. Clone this repository:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/antrew/btrfs-scrub-scheduler.git
cd btrfs-scrub-scheduler
npm install
----
2. Configure the period and filesystems you want to scrub by creating `config.json` that looks like this:
+
----
{
  "period": 30,
  "filesystems": [
    "/",
    "/mnt/example"
  ]
}
----
3. Create a cronjob that will start the scheduler daily at the beginning of the maintenance window.
